# merge_urls
This Bash script generates a "merged" URL, typically used in phishing schemes to disguise a malicious link. The user provides a phishing URL and an original URL. The script processes the input to remove unnecessary parts (like trailing slashes or protocols) and combines them into a new URL format.
